# BoredGames
A C# multiplayer game made with MonoGame and Lidgren for playing a selection of two-player games.

Working on this project helped me to learn about the basics of networking, aswell as some techniques I hadn't used before such as partial classes and lambda functions.

The list of games currently includes:

•	Chess

•	Draughts (Checkers)

•	Hasami Shogi

•	Connect Four

•	Dots and Boxes
